Ok. Little transparency here because the analysis is going to come in as a single commit.
I had some issues getting my R session from the CU server to connect to GitHub. I then went through all of the analysis, made sure the code ran, and then copy and pasted it to a R session on my computer and committed it to GitHub from there. Yeah, not correct or ideal.
After I finished all of the analysis I figured out the issue with R studio on the server and corrected it. Then made a new R file and then put that into this project. 

That is why the whole analysis comes in as 1 commit.

Not that big of a deal for more basic analysis like this. Will work on getting better at this moving forward.
